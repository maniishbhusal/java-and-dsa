# Java and DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository where I document my journey of mastering Java programming language and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). In this space, I'll be sharing code snippets, problem solutions, and insights gained along the way.

## Journey Highlights
- **Day 1**: Installed JDK, and ran the magical `Hello World!` program. Delved into the world of `Variables` and `Data Types`.
- **Day 2**: Learn to take inputs from user, type conversion, type casting, type promotion expression, Operators, Conditional Statements, Loops.
- **Day 3**: Basic Pattern Printing, Functions and Function Overloading. Solved different problems related to it.

Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ
