# Java and DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository where I document my journey of mastering Java programming language and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). In this space, I'll be sharing code snippets, problem solutions, and insights gained along the way.

## Journey Highlights

- **Day 1**: Installed JDK, and ran the magical `Hello World!` program. Delved into the world of `Variables` and `Data Types`.
- **Day 2**: Learn to take inputs from user, type conversion, type casting, type promotion expression, Operators, Conditional Statements, Loops.
- **Day 3**: Basic Pattern Printing, Functions and Function Overloading. Solved different problems related to it.
- **Day 4**: Solved problems related to Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary conversion, generated prime numbers within a specified range, and checked for palindrome numbers.
- **Day 5**: Solved different advanced pattern problems such as ZeroOne Triangle, Butterfly Pattern, Hollow Rhombus & Rectangle Pattern, Diamond Pattern and Floyd's Triangle Pattern
- **Day 6**: Solved Number Pyramid and Palindromic Pattern With Numbers Question.
- **Day 7**: Learn about Linear Search, Binary Search, & Reverse an Array.
- **Day 8**: Learned how to print pairs and subarrays within an array, and find their maximum sum using brute force, `Kadane's Algorithm`.
- **Day 9**: Solved `Trapping Rain Water` Problem.
- **Day 10**: Solved `Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock` problem and learned about `Two Pointer Algorithm`.
- **Day 11**: Solved `Rotate Array` Problem, learned `Bubble Sort`, `Selection Sort`.
- **Day 12**: Learned `Insertion Sort`, `Inbuilt Sort`, `Counting Sort`.
- **Day 13**: Solved `Spiral Matrix` and `Diagonal Sum` problem.

Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ
